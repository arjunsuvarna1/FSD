            International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is an American multinational information technology
            company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 170 countries. The company began in
            1911,
            founded in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed
            "International Business Machines" in 1924.

            IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting
            services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research
            organization, holding the record for most U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2019) for 26
            consecutive years.[5] Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the
            hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the
            UPC
            barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was
            the
            dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.

            IBM has continually shifted business operations by focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets.
            This
            includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and the sale of personal computer
            (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (in 2005 and 2014, respectively), and
            acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), The Weather Company (2016), and Red Hat
            (2019). Also in 2015, IBM announced that it would go "fabless", continuing to design semiconductors, but
            offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries.

            Nicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of
            the
            world's largest employers, with (as of 2018) over 350,000 employees, known as "IBMers". At least 70% of
            IBMers are based outside the United States, and the country with the largest number of IBMers is
            India.[6]
            IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology
            (USA) and five National Medals of Science (USA).

            IBM is nicknamed Big Blue in part due to its blue logo and color scheme,[111][112] and also partially since
            IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits.[111][113] The company logo has undergone
            several changes over the years, with its current "8-bar" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul
            Rand.[114] It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render large
            areas well. Aside from the logo, IBM used Helvetica as a corporate typeface for 50 years, until it was
            replaced in 2017 by the custom-designed IBM Plex.

            IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996,
            IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major
            championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam
            (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed
            in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).[115] As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the
            third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club.[116] IBM is also a major
            sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the
            French Open.[117] The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960–2000,[118] and the National
            Football League from 2003–2012.[119]

            In 2012, IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by Interbrand as the second-best brand
            worldwide.[120] That same year, it was also ranked the top company for leaders (Fortune), the number two
            green company in the U.S. (Newsweek),[121] the second-most respected company (Barron's),[122] the fifth-most
            admired company (Fortune), the 18th-most innovative company (Fast Company), and the number one in technology
            consulting and number two in outsourcing (Vault).[123] In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM the fifth-most valuable
            brand.[124]
